## Description
**Cryptocurrency** markets are very volatile in nature and has high trading volumes. It is also open 24 * 7 unlike traditional capital markets. This means we can get a continuous flow of data which will be super helpful for time series forecasting. On the other hand, most of the cryptocurrencies do not have the so called underlying fundamentals data and so most of the price movements are driven by technical indicators and market sentiments. This makes it one of the best play grounds for traders to make huge gains (and losses!).

In this competition, we will be looking at **14 cryptocurrencies and predict the short term price movements** of them. We will be using a time-series API that will help us from looking into the future data (try not to play around it) and make predictions.

The dataset has been collected from [G-Research_Crypto_Forecasting on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/g-research-crypto-forecasting/data) and it includes
Based on the real transaction data of 14 cryptocurrencies (highest price, lowest price, opening price, closing price, trading volume, etc.), extract features such as the increase and volume ratio of the last N days; and construct a large-cap index including 14 currencies , and calculate the increase, volume ratio and other characteristics.
This dataset contains information on historic trades for several cryptoassets, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Your challenge is to predict their future returns.

This notebook presents an introduction to crypto forecasting, describing the structure and elements of the dataset, some relevant statistical properties, as well as building a couple of LSTM Prediction and Price prediction for all assets.
